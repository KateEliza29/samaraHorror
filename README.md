# Samara Horror

## Introduction
This is a multi-page website for a horror maze and it was created in March 2020.
There were three main training purposes behind this project:
1- To improve my general design skills by using Gimp and Inkscape to create and edit images and logos. 
2- To improve my knowledge of CSS animations. 
3- To create a functioning accordion element from scratch.

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Scope and Improvements
Looking back on this project, there are many improvements that I would make, if I were to take it further: 
* Make the countdown functional. 
* Change the 'About Us' section to make it more readable. 
* Refactor the HTML to use more accessible tags. 
* Amend the side menu function.
